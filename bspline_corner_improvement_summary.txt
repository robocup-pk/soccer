B-SPLINE CORNER IMPROVEMENT SUMMARY
===================================

PROBLEM IDENTIFIED:
The "water drop" effect at corners was caused by B-spline trying to maintain smoothness with insufficient control points around sharp corners.

SOLUTION IMPLEMENTED:
1. **Preprocess waypoints** before B-spline generation
2. **Add helper waypoints** before and after corners
3. **Use lower spline degree** (quadratic instead of cubic)

KEY IMPROVEMENTS:

1. **Corner Detection**
   - Detect corners with angle > 30 degrees
   - Calculate corner radius (default 0.15m)
   
2. **Helper Waypoints**
   - Add point 15cm before corner (with previous orientation)
   - Add point 15cm after corner (with target orientation)
   - For very sharp corners (>90°), add intermediate point

3. **Results**
   - Smooth curves through corners
   - No more "water drop" artifacts
   - Better path following
   - Maintains velocity continuity

IMPLEMENTATION:
```cpp
// Before corner
Eigen::Vector3d before = corner_point;
before.head<2>() -= incoming_direction * corner_radius;
before[2] = previous_orientation;

// After corner  
Eigen::Vector3d after = corner_point;
after.head<2>() += outgoing_direction * corner_radius;
after[2] = target_orientation;
```

VISUALIZATION RESULTS:
- Original: 3 waypoints with sharp 90° corner
- Processed: 4 waypoints with smooth transition
- B-spline: Smooth curve without drops

RECOMMENDATION:
1. Use this preprocessing for all RRT* paths
2. Adjust corner_radius based on robot size/speed
3. Consider dynamic radius based on corner angle

This solves the corner cutting issue while maintaining smooth motion!
