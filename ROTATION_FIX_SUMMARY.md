# B-Spline Rotation Fix Summary

## Problem
The B-spline trajectory planner was not able to handle pure rotation around the robot's axis. When given waypoints with the same position but different orientations, it would:
1. Filter out waypoints as "too close" 
2. Compute zero arc length for pure rotations
3. Fail to generate proper angular velocities

## Root Causes
1. **Arc length computation** only considered linear distance (x,y) and ignored angular component
2. **Waypoint preprocessing** filtered based only on linear distance 
3. **Velocity scaling** failed for zero linear velocity (division by zero)

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Fixed Arc Length Computation
In `BSplineTrajectory.cpp`, modified the arc length calculation to include angular distance:

```cpp
// Consider both linear and angular distance
double linear_distance = (current_point.head<2>() - prev_point.head<2>()).norm();
double angular_distance = std::abs(NormalizeAngle(current_point[2] - prev_point[2]));

// Weight angular distance to make it comparable to linear distance
// Using robot radius of ~0.09m, so full rotation = 2*pi*0.09 â‰ˆ 0.565m
double angular_weight = 0.09;  // Convert radians to equivalent linear distance
double segment_length = linear_distance + angular_weight * angular_distance;
```

### 2. Fixed Velocity Computation
Added special handling for pure rotation cases:

```cpp
if (linear_vel_norm > 1e-6) {
    // Normal case: scale linear velocity
    double scale = current_speed / linear_vel_norm;
    feedforward_velocity = spline_velocity * scale;
} else {
    // Pure rotation case
    feedforward_velocity[0] = 0.0;
    feedforward_velocity[1] = 0.0;
    // Scale angular velocity based on desired "speed" converted to angular units
    double angular_scale = current_speed / 0.09;
    feedforward_velocity[2] = (angular_vel > 0 ? 1 : -1) * std::min(std::abs(angular_vel), angular_scale);
}
```

### 3. Fixed Waypoint Preprocessing
In `BSplineTrajectoryManager.cpp`, modified filtering to consider both linear and angular distance:

```cpp
double linear_distance = (waypoints[i].head<2>() - processed.back().head<2>()).norm();
double angular_distance = std::abs(normalized_angle_diff);

// Consider both linear and angular distance
double equivalent_distance = linear_distance + 0.09 * angular_distance;

if (equivalent_distance >= min_waypoint_distance_ || i == waypoints.size() - 1) {
    // Keep waypoint if far enough in position OR orientation
    processed.push_back(waypoints[i]);
}
```

## Test Cases Added
- **Test Case 6**: Rotation with minimal translation (5cm radius circle while rotating 360 degrees)
- **Test Case 7**: Pure rotation using original trajectory manager (for comparison)

## Results
The B-spline trajectory planner now successfully:
- Handles pure rotation around the robot's axis
- Generates smooth angular velocity profiles
- Maintains velocity limits during rotation
- Properly interpolates orientation changes

The robot can now smoothly rotate in place or follow trajectories that involve significant orientation changes without position changes.
