REPLANNING ANALYSIS SUMMARY
==========================

Based on the demo_bspline_replanning_comparison output:

OBSERVED BEHAVIOR:
1. Both robots started at different Y positions:
   - No replanning: (0, 0, 0)
   - With replanning: (0, 0.4, 0)

2. The velocity commands showed oscillations in both cases:
   - No replanning: High frequency velocity changes (e.g., 0.463394, -0.562898 m/s)
   - With replanning: Also showed oscillations with replanning triggers

3. The demo was comparing trajectory following with 75% friction efficiency applied to both robots

KEY FINDINGS:
1. Replanning triggers when position error exceeds 10cm
2. Both robots experience similar oscillatory behavior
3. The 50ms sensor delay affects both implementations

PRELIMINARY CONCLUSION:
From the partial output, replanning does NOT appear to solve the fundamental control system issues:
- Both robots show oscillatory behavior
- The delayed sensor data causes replanning to act on outdated information
- Replanning may actually introduce additional discontinuities

RECOMMENDATION:
The real issue appears to be:
1. High feedback gain (Kp=1.5) combined with sensor delay causes oscillations
2. Friction/wheel slip reduces actual movement to 75% of commanded
3. These are hardware/control gain issues, not trajectory planning issues

Replanning based on delayed sensor data may make the problem worse rather than better.
